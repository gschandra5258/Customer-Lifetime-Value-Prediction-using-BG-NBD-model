# A BG/NBD Model for Customer Lifetime Value Prediction

The following objectives were derived and implemented

1)	Performing the data preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data.

2)	Designing the statistical and data analytical models with necessary model parameters.

3)	Implementing the BG/NBD, random forest regressor, and DNN models on the defined data to predict the Customer Lifetime Value.
