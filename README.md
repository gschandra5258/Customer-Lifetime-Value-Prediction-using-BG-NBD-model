# A BG/NBD Model for Customer Lifetime Value Prediction

The following objectives were derived and implemented

1)	Performed the data preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data.

2)	Designed the statistical and data analytical models with necessary model parameters.

3)	Implemented the BG/NBD, random forest regressor, and DNN models on the defined data to predict the Customer Lifetime Value.
